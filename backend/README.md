Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server.
Fastify is a framework that helps you build web servers easily using Node.js.
There are two types of modules in JS: 
- Common JS
    const varName = require(locationName);
- ES modules.
    import varName from 'locationName'


Start working:
Initialize a Node.js Project in the Folder:  npm init -y
npm install fastify
npm install fastify-plugin @fastify/mongodb for working with a database
npm install @fastify/static for working with html

Run the server: node index.js
