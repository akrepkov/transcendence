Node.js lets to run JavaScript on the server.
Fastify is a framework that helps to build web servers easily using Node.js.
There are two types of modules in JS: 
- Common JS
    const varName = require(locationName);
- ES modules.
    import varName from 'locationName'

Start working:
Initialize a Node.js Project in the Folder:  npm init -y
npm install fastify
npm install @fastify/static for working with html
npm install sqlite3 better-sqlite3 for working with a database

Run the server: node index.js

1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Container (Fastify)
Purpose:
Runs your API and game logic

Manages authentication, matchmaking, and tournament handling

Interacts with SQLite (or another database)

Integrates with the blockchain (Avalanche testnet)

Why separate?
Keeps business logic independent of the frontend

Allows scalability (e.g., multiple backend instances with a load balancer)

Ensures security (backend is isolated, not exposed directly to users)

Dependencies:
‚úÖ Database (SQLite)
‚úÖ Blockchain API

2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Container (React/Vanilla TS)
Purpose:
Serves the Single-Page Application (SPA)

Calls the backend API to get/update user data

Displays live game updates & matchmaking

Handles Google authentication & WebSockets

Why separate?
Users access a static site ‚Üí This makes it faster

Frontend can be served via NGINX for caching & performance

Allows future upgrades without redeploying the backend

Dependencies:
‚úÖ Backend API
‚úÖ NGINX Proxy

3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Container (SQLite or Alternative DB)
Purpose:
Stores user data, game stats, tournament scores

Handles match history, friend lists, and authentication info

Works inside the backend container OR as a separate service

Why separate (Optional)?
If you use PostgreSQL/MySQL, you need a dedicated DB container

SQLite is file-based ‚Üí Can stay inside the backend

Dependencies:
‚úÖ Backend (API to interact with the DB)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Reverse Proxy Container (NGINX or Traefik)
Purpose:
Routes traffic to backend/frontend

Enforces HTTPS (SSL certificates)

Prevents attacks (DDoS, rate limiting, CORS, security headers)

Handles WebSockets for real-time game updates

Why separate?
Security & Scalability ‚Üí Exposes only necessary ports

Performance Boost ‚Üí Caches frontend assets

Required for HTTPS ‚Üí Secure communication

Dependencies:
‚úÖ Backend (API requests)
‚úÖ Frontend (SPA serving)

Next Steps
‚úÖ Need a docker-compose.yml to set everything up?
‚úÖ Want to discuss networking (e.g., how these containers talk to each other)?
‚úÖ Need help choosing SQLite vs. PostgreSQL?
