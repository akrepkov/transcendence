Routes	
Define endpoints and map them to handlers

This is where you:
Define HTTP methods + URLs (GET, POST, etc.)
Assign them to handler functions

To check the existing routes we use OpenAPI file (Swagger)
It includes:
    Available endpoints (/users) and operations on each endpoint (GET /users, POST /users)
    Operation parameters Input and output for each operation
    Authentication methods
    Contact information, license, terms of use, and other information..
