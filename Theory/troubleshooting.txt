TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
====================
Hey! This file contains things you can try when you can't launch the project or some scripts aren't working.
If none of these solutions work, contact JI (and feel free to bully him about his broken scripts).

QUICK FIXES
----------
Sometimes the simplest solution is the best:

* `make re` - This is safe to run and will delete all modules and install them fresh from the package files.
* Disable Git Hooks - If git is being annoying, just comment out the text in the files in the .husky folder.
  This will let you commit and checkout branches without all the complaints.

1. NODE/APP LAUNCH ISSUES
------------------------
When typing 'make' tries to launch the app but node throws a tantrum:

1.1 Code Problems
    First, check the error message - maybe it's just the code being weird.
    This could mean someone pushed something broken or a mistake slipped through.
    Unfortunately, I can't help you with that one!

1.2 Node Version Issues
    - Check your version with `node -v` - should be 23.11.[xx]
    - If it's wrong:
        a) Try resetting your terminal
        b) Or run: `[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"`
        c) Still wrong? `nvm` probably isn't installed right. Try `make reset all`

1.3 Makefile Bypass
    You can try running the app without the makefile:
    Just go to the backend and run npm start

1.4 Corrupt Package Files
    - Run `make reset all`
    - Choose option (1) when prompted
    This will download fresh package files from our main branch

1.5 Missing Module Drama
    If it's complaining about a missing module that's not in package.json:
    - Install it: `npm install [module]`
    - If this fixes things, we probably need this module
    - Update the package files (check workflow.txt - "Adding new packages")

1.6 Still Broken?
    Time to figure it out yourself or contact JI

2. GIT COMMIT ISSUES
-------------------
The pre-commit script is kind of strict - it fails if ANY command fails.
Quick fix: Go to .husky/pre-commit and comment everything out.
Try fixing manually and then contact JI about this problem (it's definitely his fault).

3. BRANCH CHECKOUT ISSUES
------------------------
Same deal as the commit issues - go to .husky/post-checkout and comment everything out.
Or don't pull or push when prompted. This is probably related to some divergent branch error.
Try fixing manually and don't forget to contact JI about his failures and bully him for being a dumbo.

4. PACKAGE UPDATE ISSUES
-----------------------
If `make update_json` isn't working:
This could have many different reasons - I haven't tested it thoroughly.
As we go through the project, I'll add more specific solutions here.
Since updating package files isn't super critical, just contact JI and insult him good.

Remember: When all else fails, blame JI!
